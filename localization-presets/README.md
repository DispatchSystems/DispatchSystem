# Localizer folder

In this folder contains preset versions of the language pack for DispatchSystem, select your language from the available ones in this folder

## Installation of the file

1. Rename the file from whatever the name is to `lang.json`
2. Replace the `lang.json` inside of the `ds-main` resource to switch out the language pack
3. Reload the resource (might need clearing of cache to work) for the file to be synced with server and client
4. Done! You have changed the resource language to one of the presets

## Localizers needed
