If you're a developer, ignore this.

You probably downloaded this as a zip and don't understand how to install it.
This is the source code, not the exes, dlls, and all of that.
Please visit "https://github.com/DispatchSystems/DispatchSystem/releases" to download the compiled and production-ready files.
If you have any questions, gently tap that Discord button in the readme and go to #installation-help.
